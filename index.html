		<h1>Halt</h1>
		<p>Halt is a Ranger of Araluen under the rule of King Duncan. A Ranger's primary job is to assist the King through an intelligence network created by the Ranger corps. The kingdom is split into fifty fiefs and each fief contains one Ranger. A Ranger is highly skilled in unseen movement, archery, and knife throwing. Their uncanny abilitiy to disappear and the overall secretive nature of the corps lead the common the folk to believe they are a group of sorcerers. In general a Ranger invokes a sense of unease whenever they are around. Halt is known for his legendary skills, his ingenuity that helped win several wars, and his very grim demeanor. He has no problem breaking the law to serve his Kingdom and even the King has a hard time restraining one of his most trusted advisor and friend.</p>
